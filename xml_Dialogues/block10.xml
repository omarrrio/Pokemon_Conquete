  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This kingdom's really been thriving recently. All sorts of people have been coming and going!

  <Text ID="6d">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now then...which way did I come from? Where was I going again? Erm...where am I?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6e">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Ah, hello there! How are you today? I'm the resident {Color:32}Alchemist{Color:33} round these parts, and I'm now open for business.

  <Text ID="6f">{C1}{Char:1024}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}My word... I don't recall ever seeing a {Color:32}Park{Color:33} there before! And it was full of Pokémon, all playing happily. It was a really wonderful sight!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="70">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}One, two, three! Hm? Sorry, I didn't see you there. I train Warriors and Pokémon up in the mountains.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:1028}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I have information to report! I found a {Color:32}Ravine{Color:33}, not too far from here. It was a wonderful place, the air was so clean, and there were trees everywhere... It seems some Warriors take their Pokémon there to relax. I recommend you pay it a visit sometime. {End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:1026}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I must admit that this tower has been troubling me for a while. What on earth is it?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:1025}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}According to a rumor I heard, it causes special things to happen. Things that don't happen elsewhere...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:1026}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Special things, eh...? It would appear that we need to investigate this tower!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:1025}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}But...I hear that most of the time it's just an ordinary tower. Something needs to happen to trigger these “special things,” and I just don't know what it is...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="94">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}But it's about time that I thought about retiring. Before I do that, though, I thought I'd better share some of what I've learned with you young Warriors.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="9f">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}If there's anything you want to ask about, youngster, go ahead. This old man has plenty of time on his hands.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a0">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What do you want to know about?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a1">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh really? Righto. Just keep working hard, youngster, and your Pokémon are bound to get stronger.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a2">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Pokémon have the following {Color:32}stats{Color:33}: {Color:32}Attack{Color:33}, {Color:32}Defense{Color:33}, and {Color:32}Speed{Color:33}. Improving a Pokémon's {Color:32}Attack{Color:33} means they cause more damage to enemies. Improving a Pokémon's {Color:32}Defense{Color:33} means they receive less damage from enemies.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a3">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Finally, improving a Pokémon's {Color:32}Speed{Color:33} makes it easier for their moves to hit the enemy while also making it easier for them to avoid enemy moves. Got all that?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a4">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now, all Pokémon moves have {Color:32}move ranks{Color:33}. Increasing this rank makes moves more powerful and makes it easier to achieve bonus effects after performing a move. Look at the number next to a move to see its {Color:32}move rank{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a5">{C1}{Char:1055}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}To increase a {Color:32}move rank{Color:33} to its maximum level, you will need to achieve a 100% {Color:32}link{Color:33} with your Pokémon. Moves whose {Color:32}move ranks{Color:33} are at their maximum level are super powerful, so be sure to work hard and strengthen your {Color:32}link{Color:33}, all right?{End}</Text>
