  <Text ID="a">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}From what I've seen, the Pokémon really seem to take a shine to you. So I was thinking I'd find it easier to meet some on my travels if I were with you.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="23">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}For many years, it had witnessed relentless fighting between rival Warriors, all of whom were seeking the elusive legendary Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="24">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}These increasingly brutal battles were causing the Warriors' own Pokémon to grow weary.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="25">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Then one day, in the northern kingdom of {Color:31}Dragnor{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="26">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Their ambition has corrupted them... They use their Pokémon as mere tools...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="27">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And this legendary Pokémon... It is surely no more than a myth...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="28">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}{Color:31}Nobunaga{Color:33} will prove it.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="29">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I shall bring the whole of Ransei under my control, and if the legendary Pokémon does not appear before me...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2a">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Then I will have brought dawn to Ransei's long, dark night.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="35">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You should go.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="38">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Once it has taken {Color:31}Nobunaga{Color:33}, the battles that raged around you would begin again.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="3a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so, Arceus left...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Upon hearing that the {Color:34}legendary Pokémon{Color:33} did not exist, most {Color:34}Warriors{Color:33} lost the will to go on fighting.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}In time, however, a number of them came to appreciate the joy of {Color:34}battle{Color:33} for its own sake, without concern for the quest for the {Color:34}legendary{Color:33} {Color:34}Pokémon{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so, the true meaning of {Color:34}battle{Color:33}, and the joy provided by the bond between Warrior and Pokémon, was finally rediscovered in the land of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3e">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Times were changing...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="42">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And there was a growing clamor to find out who was the fairest of them all...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="43">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}The other kingdom's Warlords are all so famous...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="44">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}And I'm just nothing by comparison...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Oh my. Aren't we modest?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="46">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Huh...? Y-You are...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="47">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Seven Warlords... All women...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="48">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}There's only one thing left to decide...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="49">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Who will be Queen of Ransei?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4a">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Q-Queen...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4b">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}You may not want to do it.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4c">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}But I think your allies probably believe you have what it takes...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4d">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}All right.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I don't believe any of this Ransei's Greatest Beauty stuff that everyone's talking about...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But I will do what I can for those who believe in me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Challenge accepted!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="52">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}I-I...won...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="54">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But it's not about who comes first...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}It's about everyone having fun, doing battle together. That's the most important thing.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="56">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Having said that...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="57">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I am really happy!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Oichi defeated the other female Warlords,{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="59">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}and became known forever as the Rose of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Ransei region...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Known for the constant battles that raged across its 17 kingdoms.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}In the kingdom of {Color:31}Ignis{Color:33}, situated in the corner of this land...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5e">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You know, I've been thinking...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5f">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Ransei is full of people and full of Pokémon, right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="60">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But it's only some people―Warriors―that can communicate with Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="61">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Don't you think it'd be great if everyone could make friends with Pokémon? What a happy world that would be!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="62">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}It's the kind of world I've always dreamed of!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="63">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}It's impossible.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="64">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The number of people blessed with the ability to communicate with Pokémon will always be limited.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="65">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Aw, {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}... You're always such a downer...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="66">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Yeah... I'll show ya!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="67">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Now, the storybooks say that this world was created by a legendary Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="68">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And they also say that the one who captures all 17 castles gets to see this Pokémon, right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="69">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You're not...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6a">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Yeah! I am!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6b">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I'm gonna summon the legendary Pokémon, and together we're gonna change this world!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6c">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6d">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I did it... I finally did it...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6e">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Huh?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6f">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Wh-What's that...?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="70">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Lord {Color:31}Hideyoshi{Color:33}... Isn't that...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="71">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}It's here! The legendary Pokémon!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="72">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}It won't be long now! Soon we'll have a world where all people can live happily together with Pokémon!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="73">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And from that moment on...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Color:34}Ransei{Color:33} was united under Hideyoshi's leadership, and conflict was banished from the region.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="75">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}As a result, it became easier for {Color:34}Pokémon{Color:33} and people to understand one another.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The fact that this change was brought about through the power of Arceus, however, was known to no one...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}In the region of Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}, Warlord of {Color:30}Dragnor{Color:33}, had conquered ten kingdoms.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}His influence had almost reached the kingdom of {Color:31}Fontaine{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Hehe... How feeble. If uniting Ransei is really going to be this easy...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7c">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Then very soon it shall all be mine!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7d">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Hehehe... Hahahaha!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7e">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}So he's coming...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7f">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}{Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}... The one who has the power to create an era of his own... To unite this region...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="80">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Well, he won't sweep me away that easily.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="81">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}...Three years.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="82">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Within three years, I will have driven {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} away.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="83">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I will be the one who leaves my mark on Ransei!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="84">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="85">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I did it... I drove {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} away...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="86">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But there will be a second {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}. And a third...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="87">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I must defeat all of them. I must continue to resist tyranny in all its forms.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="88">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Motochika defeated Nobunaga.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="89">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}He stood firm against the dark tide and showed great courage and skill in {Color:34}battle{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Indeed, his talents were already becoming too great for the borders of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33} to contain...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Times were changing...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="90">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}This contest... You're not happy about it, are you, {Color:31}Ginchiyo{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="91">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Of course not.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="92">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Being the fairest and mightiest woman is of no interest to me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="93">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But if I must go through this before Ransei can be united in my name... {Wait:30}20{Color:31}Muneshige{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="94">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}What is it?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="95">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You are not to get involved in these battles. My own powers alone shall be enough.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="97">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Then I shall take a little trip.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="98">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}As you wish.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="99">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}The people of Ransei shall soon learn the name of our clan. It is our destiny...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9a">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}These battles must be won!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9b">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9c">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Central Ransei is under my command...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="9e">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Hmm. That doesn't sound like you.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9f">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}{Color:31}Muneshige{Color:33}... You're back.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a0">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I am. I wanted to see your face again, {Color:31}Ginchiyo{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a1">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}I... You... Cease your tomfoolery!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a2">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}There may be ten kingdoms left for you to conquer, but the armies that protect them are nothing special.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a3">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}It is only a matter of time before you unite this region, {Color:31}Ginchiyo{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a4">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}I-I know that!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a5">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Ha... {End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a6">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}It would appear that you still do not need me, then. I shall take my leave.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a7">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}Wh-Where are you going?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a8">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Wherever the wind may take me, I suppose.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a9">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Ginchiyo, who had won the contest among the female Warlords,{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="aa">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}set her sights on the whole of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}, and steeled herself for the battles that lay ahead...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ab">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ac">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Name}{C1} had successfully united Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ad">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And returned all its castles to their original owners.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ae">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}In {Color:31}Greenleaf{Color:33}, however, {Color:31}Motonari{Color:33} had something on his mind...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="af">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I know this is a bit sudden...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b0">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But it's no secret that I've always wanted to be a Pokémon researcher.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b1">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}To that end...I want to expand my horizons and meet some new Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b2">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}In order to do so, of course, I shall need an army...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b3">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I take it there are no objections?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b4">{C1}{Char:0089}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}L-Lord {Color:31}Motonari{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b5">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}What is it?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b6">{C1}{Char:0088}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Y-You're not going to try and conquer Ransei?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b7">{C1}{Char:0088}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I never thought I'd ever hear you say such a thing!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b8">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Oh no, certainly not.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b9">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}My only aim is to link with some new Pokémon. Let's say...a hundred or so.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ba">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}I hope you can help me achieve this goal!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bb">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bc">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Well, it looks like I managed to reach my target. One hundred Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bd">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I've met all sorts of different ones along the way...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="be">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But I'm sure there are some Pokémon that I still haven't come across...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bf">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}What an exciting thought!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c0">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}...But it can wait for tomorrow.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c1">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}For now, I think I had better take a rest.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c2">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Motonari successfully gathered one hundred {Color:34}Pokémon{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c3">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}and was able to spend the rest of his days happily engrossed in his research.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c4">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c5">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}In the region of Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c6">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Color:31}Nobunaga{Color:33}, Warlord of {Color:31}Dragnor{Color:33}, had been instigating a series of increasingly brutal battles,{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c7">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}and now had eleven kingdoms under his command.{End}</Text>
