  <Text ID="11">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}We must battle against the Warriors of {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}'s army.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="16">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{Color:30}Avia{Color:33}? Well, it's home to lots of Flying-type Pokémon.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="29">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}Hmph. I guess I must have let my guard down.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2a">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}I won't go so easy on you next time, {Name}{C1}!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="2c">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I mean, if we were to join {Name}{C1}'s army...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="31">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}All right...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="32">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I hope to see you again, {Name}{C1}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="33">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Hmph. You really thought you could defeat me?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="34">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}What an imbecile. I hope you've learned your lesson and you don't have any more stupid ideas like that!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="38">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}You're right! |02,cc{C1} has transformed!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="39">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I knew it! Well, that's good news.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3a">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Here, let me give you a little something to celebrate.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Items received: {Color:32}Fire Stone{Color:33}, {Color:32}Water Stone{Color:33}, and {Color:32}Thunderstone{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3c">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}If you go into battle after giving one of those to a certain Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3d">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}like your little {Color:31}Eevee{Color:33}, you might just see something pretty special.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3e">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}then you might just see something special. Evolution!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3f">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Each stone will lead to a different result, but your little Pokémon might just evolve.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="40">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Think about it, and use them wisely.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="41">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:34}...You know, you really are looking pretty impressive these days.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="42">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:34}I don't think you'll be needing any more advice from me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="43">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}In fact, I'd better be off.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="44">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}See you around!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Most of the Warriors in {Color:30}Cragspur{Color:33} have Rock-type Pokémon for partners.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="46">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Water-type, Grass-type, and Fighting-type attacks are strong against Rock-type Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="47">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But Fire types and Bug types are pretty useless.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="48">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Normal-type Pokémon's attacks aren't very effective either...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="49">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Cragspur{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4a">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}So you're {Name}{C1}... The one who's captured all those castles in the west.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4b">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Half of Ransei is already yours. What are you gonna do next?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4c">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Too much ambition can be pretty dangerous, you know...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4d">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}This isn't ambition!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:0028}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Quiet, you! We don't have time to listen to your silly excuses.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}That's right. I have things to do. Let's get this settled!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}...So you're back?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I'm sure you must have your own reasons for being so stubborn...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="52">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}It'd be rude of me not to indulge you. Let's do it.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:0028}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:34}No! We lost again!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="54">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}First {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}, now this... Maybe I'm getting old...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}Okay, it looks like I don't have a choice. The castle is yours, {Name}{C1}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="56">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But... What will you do?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="57">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}We belong to {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}'s army. Now that our castle's gone, we've got to go back to him.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I don't much like that {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}, but I can't see any other way...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="59">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}See you, {Name}{C1}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I hope one day you become strong enough to...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5b">{C1}{Char:0028}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}See that?! Now you know what we can do!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5c">{C1}{Char:0028}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}So scuttle back to wherever you came from, all right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5d">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}...We'll be meeting again soon, {Name}{C1}. I'm sure of it.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5e">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}|02,cc{C1}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5f">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I-It's my Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="60">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{Color:31}Jigglypuff{Color:33} has been acting kind of funny ever since we started fighting against {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}'s army, {End}</Text>
  <Text ID="61">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}And just now, she gave me this...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="62">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You received a {Color:32}Jigglypuff Charm{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="63">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}What on earth is it? I mean, it looks like it might be really rare...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="64">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I heard that lots of Warriors in {Color:30}Yaksha{Color:33} use Dark-type Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="65">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Fighting-type and Bug-type attacks are effective against Dark-type Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="66">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But Psychic-type attacks are completely useless.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="67">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Also, I don't really recommend taking a Ghost-type Pokémon with us...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="68">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Yaksha{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="69">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Ha... So you're {Name}{C1}...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6a">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Powerful enough to stand alongside {Color:31}Shingen{Color:33} and {Color:31}Kenshin{Color:33}, so they say.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6b">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}It will make it all the more satisfying to destroy you.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6c">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Wha―?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6d">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}{Name}{C1}... You may be the source of great chaos in Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6e">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}But you are just a source of entertainment for me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6f">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Ha. So you came back...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="70">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}I suppose I have time to toy with you some more...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="71">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Ha...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="72">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}If only for a moment, you kept me entertained.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="73">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Your impending battle with {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}... The thought of it excites me...more than I expected.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Farewell.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="75">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}...That sounds pretty ominous.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I guess {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}'s army is full of people like him...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Stopping you in your tracks... Such fun.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Come and entertain me again. I have all the time in the world.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}|02,cc{C1}... {Color:30}Viperia{Color:33} is a venomous kingdom...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}So most of the Pokémon we'll find there are Poison-type Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}This means that Grass-type Pokémon will struggle...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7c">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But Ground-type and Psychic-type Pokémon should do well.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Viperia{Color:33}{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="7f">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}You're the one who's trying to fight {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}, right? You naughty child!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="81">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}Stop being so silly! If you don't learn to get along with people, I'm going to have to punish you!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="82">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Isn't that right, {Color:30}Hideyoshi{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="83">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Sure thing, {Color:30}Nene{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="84">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Y-You're...{Color:30}Hideyoshi{Color:33}?! From {Color:31}Ignis{Color:33}?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="85">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}But you look so different... Surely you haven't...transformed?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="86">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Long time no see, {Name}{C1}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="87">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}A whole lot has changed since I decided to let you have my castle in {Color:31}Ignis{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="88">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}As you can see, {Color:30}Nene{Color:33} here is the one who has to put up with me now!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="89">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}And I'll tell you something else that's gonna be different: this time, I'm gonna beat you!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}Now, {Name}{C1}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}Didn't I tell you to stop being naughty?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}Looks like I need to teach you that lesson again!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8d">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:34}Awww... I lost!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8e">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}Sorry, everyone... Looks like I couldn't protect {Color:30}Viperia{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8f">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}I couldn't repay Lord {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="90">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}Even though he let us keep looking after our kingdom after we lost to him...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="91">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}I guess he's going to be pretty mad now...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="92">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}We've gotta go back to him, though, {Color:30}Nene{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="93">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Lord {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} isn't someone you turn your back on.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="95">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Lord {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} is the only one who can help me fulfill my dream!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="96">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Yeah... I guess you're right.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="97">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}And, {Name}{C1}... I guess you're not that naughty after all...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="98">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Just take good care of {Color:30}Viperia{Color:33}, all right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="99">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}There! That should put an end to your bad behavior!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9a">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:33}I won't tell you again; you have to learn to get along with people!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9b">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Ooh...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9c">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Very impressive. It would appear that no one has yet been able to match you...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9d">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Y-You're...{Color:30}Mitsuhide{Color:33}! Wh-Why are you―?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9e">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I heard that someone was attempting to oppose Lord {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}. I decided to come and see for myself who would be so foolish.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9f">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I am here to inform you that your current course of action will lead only to defeat.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a0">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I therefore suggest that you abandon this folly.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a1">{C1}{Char:0000}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}...!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a2">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}That is all...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a3">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}...That was {Color:30}Mitsuhide{Color:33}... One of {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}'s closest aides...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a4">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}There are three of them in total, and they guard his remaining three kingdoms.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a5">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}They're going to be tough opponents...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a6">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}So let's brace ourselves for battle, |02,cc{C1}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a7">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You are now able to challenge the Warlords of {Color:30}Valora{Color:33}, {Color:30}Spectra{Color:33}, and {Color:30}Nixtorm{Color:33} to battle.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a8">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{Color:30}Valora{Color:33}? Let's see...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a9">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Most moves are pretty ineffective against the Steel-type Pokémon we'll find in {Color:30}Valora{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="aa">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Poison-type Pokémon in particular will find it really tough...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ab">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But Fire-type, Fighting-type, and Ground-type Pokémon might do a little better!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ac">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Valora{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ad">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}|02,cc{C1}! At last! I have been waiting most patiently for your arrival...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ae">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Now, allow me to introduce some of the Warriors who serve me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="af">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I am {Color:30}Tadakatsu{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b0">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}And I am {Color:30}Ina{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b1">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Lord {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} and I are old acquaintances.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b2">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}The idea of betraying him is simply unthinkable.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b3">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}As a result, I am honor bound to do battle to the full extent of my abilities.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b4">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Oh... You return once more, {Name}{C1}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b5">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I suppose there is no need for me to ask why...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b6">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Come, let us proceed to the battlefield.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b7">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}Defeat... Surely not... Bravo, |02,cc{C1}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b8">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}It would appear that my army was incapable of halting your progress...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b9">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Now go, |02,cc{C1}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ba">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I shall be watching your forthcoming battle against Lord {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} with great interest.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bb">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}An impressive performance, |02,cc{C1}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bc">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}And yet you were defeated all the same...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bd">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I believe it is time for you to leave this kingdom now.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="be">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}So, next up is {Color:30}Spectra{Color:33}, right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bf">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{Color:30}Spectra{Color:33} is where Ransei's Ghost-type Pokémon tend to gather.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c0">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Normal-type and Fighting-type attacks have no effect on Ghost-type Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c1">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But Dark-type Pokémon should do well against them.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c2">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Spectra{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c3">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Wow! You're cute!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c4">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Come to see our Warlord, have you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c5">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Hey! We have a visitor!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c6">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}My, my... If it isn't {Name}{C1}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c7">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Thank you so much for coming all the way out here.{End}</Text>
