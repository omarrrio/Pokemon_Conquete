  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:1051}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh. I guess you still don't feel like helping out...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="54">{C1}{Char:1052}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What?! Surely you can afford to give us a little bit of help!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:1052}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What?! Are you really turning me down again?!{End}</Text>
