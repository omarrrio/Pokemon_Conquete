    {Unk2 P:6}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Gah... I never thought you'd let them get the better of you, {Poke}{C1}.{End}

    {Unk2 P:30}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}How could you be so cruel to my poor little {Poke}{C1}?{End}
    {Unk2 P:31}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}I don't care about my own life... But {Poke}{C1}'s is another matter!{End}

    {Unk2 P:112}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Dear oh dear, no mercy on the elderly...{End}
    {Unk2 P:113}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}We have to retreat for now... But next time victory will be ours!{End}
    {Unk2 P:114}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Oh goodness, how strong you are! I think that we must withdraw. {End}
    {Unk2 P:116}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Pah, this is unbelievable! I'll remember this!{End}
    {Unk2 P:117}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Huh? What?! I'll remember this, you know!{End}
    {Unk2 P:118}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}The enemy's competence is astounding. {End}
    {Unk2 P:119}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Oh dear... They were just so terribly strong... {End}
    {Unk2 P:121}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Well, well... What fine enemies we have today... {End}
    {Unk2 P:122}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Hmm... Our training must have been insufficient. {End}
    {Unk2 P:123}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}We lose... Let us retreat...{End}
    {Unk2 P:124}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}You were superior! But next time, I will triumph!{End}
    {Unk2 P:125}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Hmm... Our opponents fight most impressively.{End}
    {Unk2 P:126}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Oh no! We lost... I can't believe it!{End}
    {Unk2 P:128}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}They got us... Well, we won't lose the next one, that's for sure. {End}
    {Unk2 P:129}{C1}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Of course, we lost on purpose, you know...{End}
