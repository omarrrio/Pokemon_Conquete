  <Text ID="2d">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Hm. Well, I'm sure a worthy opponent will come along eventually.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2e">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I'll just have to wait!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="33">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}People with the ability to communicate with Pokémon were referred to using the title of Warrior.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="35">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}for whom the protection of their lords was the only goal. These loyal Warriors were known as ninjas.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="37">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}when it all became too much for one of their colleagues, a young ninja named {Color:31}Nene{Color:33}...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="3a">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Now, just give me a minute...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3b">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}All right, I'm back!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3c">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Now, I've borrowed some nearby castles so we can settle this once and for all.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3d">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}So less arguing and more battling. All right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3e">{C1}{Char:0023}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Are we really going to do this?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3f">{C1}{Char:0022}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="40">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Ha... This will be enjoyable.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="41">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}All right? Now only use your Poison-type, Ghost-type, and Dark-type Pokémon, just like a ninja should!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="42">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And... We need one more type, so...Dragon will do just fine!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="43">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Now, we start with two castles each, and the first to get all the castles wins!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="44">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I'll be taking part too, of course!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}All right, let's go!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="46">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="47">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}All right, I won fair and square, so you can all listen to me!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="48">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}You've got to stop arguing!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="49">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}We're all good people deep down, right? Why can't we just be friends?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4a">{C1}{Char:0022}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4b">{C1}{Char:0023}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Hmm...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4c">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Ha. How quaint.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4d">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Quiet, you! No more back talk. We're all going to get along, okay?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so the ninja conflict drew to a close.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Nene was the victor.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But whether the other three actually became friends is another story altogether...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="57">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}This region isn't big enough for the both of us. We need to settle this once and for all.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}What do you say? {Wait:30}20First to win five battles can call themselves victorious?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="59">{C1}{Char:0012}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Interesting... I accept your challenge.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Hah! I knew you would, {Color:30}Kenshin{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5b">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}All right, let's get started.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5c">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The time for standing around chatting is over!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5d">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5e">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}So the contest has been decided...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5f">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But it took so much longer than expected... I'm exhausted...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="60">{C1}{Char:0024}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}A-Are you all right, my lord?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="61">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Yes... But I can no longer continue as Warlord...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="62">{C1}{Char:0024}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}My lord!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="63">{C1}{Char:0023}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Don't say things like that! You know Lord {Color:31}Yukimura{Color:33} will take you seriously!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="64">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Hahaha...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="65">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Funnily enough...I was thinking of asking {Color:31}Yukimura{Color:33} here to be my successor.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="66">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The battle with {Color:30}Kenshin{Color:33} was fun.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="68">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I'm beginning to think that my battling days are behind me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="69">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Shingen won the conflict that divided {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33},{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}and the battle between two of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}'s most celebrated {Color:34}Warlords{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}would be spoken of for many years to come.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6c">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="71">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}So...{Wait:30}20 You're the Warlord who wants to hire me, yeah?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="72">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well, I'm sorry, I have my principles. I don't fight for people who don't meet my standards.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="73">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Aren't you listening?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I'm going to unite all of Ransei! Don't you want to see that happen?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="75">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:31}Heh! Uniting Ransei? This gets better and better...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}But I guess that ain't a bad ambition.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}All right. I'll join you.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Good.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}With you on my side, it shall not be long until all this is mine!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Well? Didn't I tell you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7c">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Didn't I tell you I'd be uniting Ransei?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7d">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You did well.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7e">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I really didn't think you had it in you back then...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7f">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Hm? What did you say, {Color:31}Magoichi{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="80">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Me? Oh, nothing...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="81">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Anyway, {Color:31}Masamune{Color:33}... Looks like you got what you wanted.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="82">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Or is Ransei just not enough for you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="83">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Of course it isn't!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="84">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I was destined for greater things than the little scrap of land known as Ransei!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="85">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Next I shall travel across the oceans, where unknown lands await...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="86">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Accompany me, {Color:31}Magoichi{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="87">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I have united Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="88">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}But this is just the beginning!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="89">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Next I shall travel across the oceans, where unknown lands await...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Masamune achieved his ambition of uniting {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}As for what he did next...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Well, that's another story.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="9c">{C1}{Char:0027}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Missing him already, {Color:31}Kenshin{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9d">{C1}{Char:0027}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You'll probably never have to deal with an opponent as powerful as {Color:30}Shingen{Color:33} again.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9e">{C1}{Char:0027}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}In fact, I think you need to think about the next generation.{End}</Text>
