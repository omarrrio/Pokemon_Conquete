  <Text ID="6">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh, that's right! I was going to teach you how to make new allies. Well, it's pretty easy...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Not all Warriors are part of an army, you see.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}There are plenty of free Warriors around as well, ones that are unattached.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}For example... Um... Ah, I know! Go and have a look in that {Color:32}Cave{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}There's probably one or two in there. Start by seeing if you can recruit them.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:34}Hm? Me? Nah. I'm a bit of a free spirit, so I'm not keen on staying in one place for too long.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}And anyway, I've got some things I need to buy in the {Color:32}Shop{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="d">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}See you later, {Name}{C1}!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="14">{C1}{Char:0059}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Well, you're going to have to show me what you can do first!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="15">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Defeat this Warrior within 4 turns!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="16">{C1}{Char:0062}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Are you here in search of allies, perhaps?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="17">{C1}{Char:0062}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Hm? Would I like to join you? I suppose if you were to impress me sufficiently...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="1f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}defeating them using a supereffective move,{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="20">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}or defeating them without any of your allies suffering damage.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="21">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}There are, however, some free Warriors who can only be recruited by fulfilling certain other special conditions.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="23">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Our army is growing nicely. I think things are looking up, |02,cc{C1}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="24">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:33}Hmph. Feeling pretty happy with yourself, huh?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="25">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Oh!{Wait:30}20 You again...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="26">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I hope you're not resting on your laurels just because you've conquered {Color:31}Ignis{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="27">{C1}{Char:0000}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}...!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="28">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Because {Color:31}Aurora{Color:33} is surrounded by other kingdoms...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="29">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}And there's still {Color:30}Greenleaf{Color:33} and {Color:30}Fontaine{Color:33} to go.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2a">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}You know, the Warriors of {Color:31}Ignis{Color:33}... They mostly used Fire-type Pokémon, right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2b">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Strong against Grass, weak against Water...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2c">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Heh. Everybody knows that, of course.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2d">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Anyway, I hear that the Warlord of {Color:30}Greenleaf{Color:33} uses Grass-type Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2e">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:33}What are you two talking about? I don't understand any of this!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="30">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}have any interest in trying to conquer other kingdoms.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="31">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I reckon now's your chance to make a move.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="32">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:33}Come on. We don't have time to stand around here chatting.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="33">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:33}We've got to get to the {Color:32}Ponigiri Shop{Color:33} and increase our Pokémon's Energy.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="34">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="35">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}It sounds like there's just no way of avoiding battle...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="36">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You are now able to challenge the Warlords of {Color:30}Greenleaf{Color:33} and {Color:30}Fontaine{Color:33} to battle.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="37">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The more kingdoms you conquer, the more places you'll be able to travel to.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="38">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You'll meet new Pokémon, too. And each kingdom will have all sorts of interesting new locations to visit.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="39">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Select a castle belonging to {Name}{C1}'s army to command your Warriors to move.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3a">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You won't send me off on my own anywhere, will you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3b">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I'd like to stay with you, |02,cc{C1}, if that's all right.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3c">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{Color:30}Fontaine{Color:33} is home to lots of Water-type Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3d">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Fire-type Pokémon might find it hard...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3e">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But Grass-type and Electric-type Pokémon should be really useful!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Fontaine{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="40">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}You wish to challenge me in battle... And what might your name be?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="41">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}So you are {Name}{C1}...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="42">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I'd heard that {Color:31}Aurora{Color:33} had a new Warlord...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="43">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}But I always thought that we would meet on the battlefield in {Color:31}Aurora{Color:33}, not here.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="44">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Well, never mind. A battle is a battle, no matter where it takes place.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Ha...{Wait:30}20 You're back, are you, {Name}{C1}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="46">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Fine. We will do battle once more!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="47">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}You won fair and square. The kingdom of {Color:31}Fontaine{Color:33} is yours.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="48">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}But even though my castle is lost, my Pokémon will never leave me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="49">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Together, we will continue to resist the tides of fate.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4a">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}You're too soft...{Wait:30}20 That's your fatal flaw...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4b">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}You must fight, {Name}{C1}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4c">{C1}{Char:0004}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}For your present...{Wait:30}20 And for your future...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4d">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}So the Warlord of {Color:30}Greenleaf{Color:33} uses Grass Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}That means our Fire-types should shine!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Water-types will be in for a long, hard battle, though...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Greenleaf{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Hmm... {Wait:30}20You're the new Warlord of {Color:31}Aurora{Color:33}, aren't you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="52">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:34}I've heard a lot about you... But I didn't expect you to be this young.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I suppose you need a bit of youthful energy in this rough old world.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="54">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Maybe it's time for my generation to call it a day...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:0088}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Lord {Color:30}Motonari{Color:33}! How can you say such a thing?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="56">{C1}{Char:0089}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Our army would fall apart without your wisdom, Lord {Color:30}Motonari{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="57">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}Whew... No rest for the wicked, eh?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}I suppose I'd better do what's expected of me...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="59">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Aha, {Name}{C1}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}...Here for another battle, are you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5b">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}Well, I'll say it again... No rest for the wicked...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5c">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:32}I knew the day would finally come when I'd face defeat on my own battlefield.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5d">{C1}{Char:0088}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Lord {Color:30}Motonari{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5e">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Surely now I can be left in peace?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5f">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}You are a more worthy Warlord for {Color:31}Greenleaf{Color:33} than I, {Name}{C1}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="60">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}I ask only that you take good care of my beloved kingdom.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="61">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}That's enough for today.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="62">{C1}{Char:0006}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Perhaps now you can leave me in peace for a while?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="63">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Oh. |02,cc{C1}...{Wait:30}20 Congratulations...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="64">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="65">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}You've heard the stories too, haven't you, |02,cc{C1}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="66">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}The legendary Pokémon who is said to appear before the one who conquers all the kingdoms...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="67">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}The truth is that...{Wait:30}20right now...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="68">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Ransei is on the brink of destruction...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="69">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Far to the north of Aurora...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A certain {Color:34}Warlord{Color:33} had set out on the road to conquest.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}His name was Nobunaga...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}His stated aim was to conquer all of the kingdoms{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}and destroy {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6e">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}If {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} is trying to destroy Ransei,{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6f">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}he probably wants to use the power of the legendary Pokémon to do so.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="70">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}So...{Wait:30}20 I think we should find this legendary Pokémon before {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33} does!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="71">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}That way, we can save Ransei!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="72">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}...Luckily, {Color:30}Nobunaga{Color:33}'s reach doesn't extend this far south yet.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="73">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Color:30}Pugilis{Color:33}, {Color:30}Violight{Color:33}, and {Color:30}Chrysalia{Color:33} are the three kingdoms that are nearest to us.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Each of their Warlords is famed far and wide for their courage and strength.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="75">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}If we could get them to join us, our army would be truly formidable...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You are now able to challenge the Warlords of {Color:30}Pugilis{Color:33}, {Color:30}Violight{Color:33}, and {Color:30}Chrysalia{Color:33} to battle.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}We're up against some pretty fearsome opponents this time...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{Color:30}Pugilis{Color:33}, especially, is full of Fighting-type Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}They might be too strong for Normal-type Pokémon like {Color:31}Eevee{Color:33} and {Color:31}Jigglypuff{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}And I have a feeling these Warlords might try invading our kingdoms, too...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}If we don't station Warriors to defend our castles, we could be in trouble...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7c">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Just be careful, all right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7d">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}|02,cc{C1}! One of our kingdoms doesn't have any Warriors stationed there!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7e">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Just think if the enemy were to invade now, |02,cc{C1}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7f">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}There are lots of Fighting-type Pokémon in {Color:30}Pugilis{Color:33}...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="85">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I've been waiting for you.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="86">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Waiting? What do you―?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="87">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}The so-called Warlords of this area are pathetic weaklings.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="88">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Invading their kingdoms would be no fun at all.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="89">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Something does seem to be kicking off in the north... But that's still far away.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}And now you're here.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I think this could be the most fun I've had in years!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Oh! Back again, are you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8d">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}And after such a crushing defeat last time...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8e">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Still, I'm glad to see you!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8f">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Phew...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="90">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}You are a worthy winner.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="91">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}But this is all part of the rich tapestry of battle.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="93">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Anyway, congratulations. You won a battle that will be talked about for years to come.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="95">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}But you have to overcome those odds, or it's no fun.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="96">{C1}{Char:0008}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Aren't you getting tired of losing all the time?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="97">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}We did it, |02,cc{C1}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="98">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Look, |02,cc{C1}, isn't that...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="99">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:34}Hey, it's you again! Never thought I'd see you here...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9a">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What do you think of this kingdom, then?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9b">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Well, it's quite far from {Color:31}Aurora{Color:33}... And there are lots of Pokémon here that we've never seen before.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9c">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:34}There sure are! You should {Color:32}link{Color:33} with some of them and make them your partners!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9d">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}...!{Wait:30}20 B-But we have {Poke}{C1} and {Color:31}Jigglypuff{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9e">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Sure... But don't you want to try getting to know some other Pokémon?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9f">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Everyone's got their own perfect partner...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a0">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}By which I mean a Pokémon with whom you can form a {Color:32}Perfect Link{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a1">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}R-Really...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a2">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Just remember that the number of Pokémon partners you can have depends on your {Color:32}Capacity{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a3">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Anyway, I recommend you give some other Pokémon a try while you're here!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a4">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Pokémon that live in the wild are called wild Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a5">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Wild Pokémon who have an affinity for a certain Warrior will be indicated by a ⅝ or ⅜ mark above their heads.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a6">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a7">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Those with an especially strong affinity will be indicated with a ⅛ mark.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a8">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Try and find the perfect partner for every one of your Warriors!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a9">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Move adjacent to a wild Pokémon, and you will be able to select ⅕.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="aa">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ab">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hey!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ac">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}You... We keep bumping into you...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ad">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Looks like you've captured a lot of kingdoms now...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ae">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Surely you're not trying to run them all by yourself?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="af">{C1}{Char:0000}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}...?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b0">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}B-But |02,cc{C1} is the Warlord, the leader of our army...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b1">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Being a Warlord is about more than just doing battle, you know.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b2">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now, you can choose what goes on in your kingdoms in your absence...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b3">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Or instead, you can {Color:32}delegate{Color:33} control of a kingdom to another Warrior.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b4">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:31}It's got to be {Color:32}training{Color:33}! That's the best way to spend your time!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b5">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Tsk. I think {Color:32}searching{Color:33} for Warriors and Pokémon is more important.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b6">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Much more important!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b7">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:33}Ha! You two never think ahead.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b8">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:33}You won't get anywhere unless you {Color:32}develop{Color:33} your army.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b9">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}...But it's up to you, of course. Just be sure to give it some thought!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ba">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Select a castle that contains an allied Warrior to {Color:32}delegate{Color:33} the day-to-day running of your kingdom.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bb">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{Color:30}Violight{Color:33} is a kingdom ravaged by thunderstorms... Perhaps that's why there are so many Electric-type Pokémon here.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bc">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}It's a tough place for Water-type and Flying-type Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bd">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Ground-type Pokémon are the best choice...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="be">{C1}{Char:0002}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But Grass-type Pokémon are also pretty strong against electrical attacks.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bf">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Kingdom of {Color:30}Violight{Color:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c0">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}So you're {Name}{C1}, are you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c1">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Hmm. I was wondering what you'd be like... And I have to conclude that you're no match for me and my {Color:30}Shinx{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c2">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:31}Ha... {End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c3">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}What's wrong?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c4">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}You. You're a child.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c5">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Talking like that to a Warrior before you've even done battle.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c6">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}Fine!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c7">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:32}{CharImage:30}I'll stop talking and demonstrate my power on the battlefield instead!{End}</Text>
