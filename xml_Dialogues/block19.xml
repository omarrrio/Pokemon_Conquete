  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Now, make sure you don't let me down, {Color:31}Yukimura{Color:33}. Or else I'm going to look very stupid.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:0024}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Yes, my lord. I shall do my best to live up to your expectations...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:0024}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Rest assured that I will put my life on the line to ensure victory!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Yes, yes... That's the spirit. Okay, then, whenever you're ready...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="52">{C1}{Char:0024}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You did it, {Color:31}Yukimura{Color:33}. I knew you would.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:0024}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But I fear my abilities are not as honed as they could be...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="56">{C1}{Char:0023}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Lord {Color:31}Yukimura{Color:33}! You're way too hard on yourself!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But for once, I would like it if you could celebrate your success.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:0023}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Stop it!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5b">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Hahaha!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so, Yukimura won the contest between the junior Warriors...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And would, before long, become a {Color:34}Warlord{Color:33} for real...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="64">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Heh! I didn't think you'd be so generous!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="65">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You do realize that you're going to have to give up your castle to a stranger, don't you?{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="67">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}This is a chance for me to observe all of the Warriors' abilities.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="69">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Of course, you don't have to do it if you don't want to...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="6e">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}You won, {Color:31}Magoichi{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6f">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Heh. 'Course I did.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="70">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}So what did you think? Did you learn anything watching it all?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="71">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}It was...fairly enlightening.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="72">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}All those famous Warriors... If I could get them to join me...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="73">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Yeah...{Wait:30}20 I learned something too.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I learned about the responsibilities of running a kingdom.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}And I also learned that Warlords are big hits with the ladies!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:0025}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Much more so than normal Warriors!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:0011}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Wh-What?!{Wait:30}20 How can you...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Magoichi won the contest between the junior Warriors...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The question of whether he had really become popular throughout the {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33} region, however...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:0026}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You are too kind, my lord.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:0026}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}We fought with love for our Pokémon and with righteousness in our hearts!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:0026}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Our victory shall resonate with people through the region!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8d">{C1}{Char:0026}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Soon, justice will reign throughout the world!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="8f">{C1}{Char:0027}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}...Perhaps you did too well.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="90">{C1}{Char:0026}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}What do you mean, my lady?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="91">{C1}{Char:0027}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Oh...nothing...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="92">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Kanetsugu won the contest of the junior Warriors.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="93">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And the principle of righteousness he taught the world through his {Color:34}battles{Color:33}{End}</Text>
