    {Unk2 P:0}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}I've got to give it everything I've got!{End}
    {Unk2 P:1}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}I've got to give it everything I've got!{End}
    {Unk2 P:2}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}...And charge onward! Ever onward!{End}
    {Unk2 P:3}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Right! Then let's do it!{End}
    {Unk2 P:4}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Let's fight to the end, {Poke}{C1}!{End}
    {Unk2 P:5}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}{Poke}{C1} and I will fight until the bitter end.{End}
    {Unk2 P:6}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}That is the very strength on which my clan prides itself!{End}
    {Unk2 P:7}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}I particularly like it when I catch sight of a Pokémon I've never seen before!{End}
    {Unk2 P:8}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Isn't that so, {Poke}{C1}?{End}
    {Unk2 P:9}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}We must simply fight the best way we know and see what happens!{End}
    {Unk2 P:10}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}So let's both try our very, very hardest, okay, {Poke}{C1}?{End}
    {Unk2 P:11}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Everything in moderation―that's my motto.{End}
    {Unk2 P:12}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Behold with awe, as we seize this victory for ourselves!{End}
    {Unk2 P:13}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}With this battle, {Poke}{C1} and I will put the world to rights. {End}
    {Unk2 P:14}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Doesn't anyone ever play Pokémari on this battlefield?{End}
    {Unk2 P:15}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I'm just getting started!{End}
    {Unk2 P:16}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}How devoted you all are to your cause...{End}
    {Unk2 P:17}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Let's stir things up as best we can... {End}
    {Unk2 P:18}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}We cannot afford to give anything but our very best.{End}
    {Unk2 P:19}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}They'd be a lot better if you could win them in your sleep, don't you think?{End}
    {Unk2 P:20}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}What matters is that we act in anticipation of what is to come once the battle is over. {End}
    {Unk2 P:21}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}That's how we should live, me and you... Just as we want to...{End}
    {Unk2 P:22}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}I want to know more! More!{End}
    {Unk2 P:23}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}A ninja needs only to fulfill his duty...{End}
    {Unk2 P:24}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}It's kind of true, except this time it's gonna be me and {Poke}{C1} together.{End}
    {Unk2 P:25}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}They will find themselves taught a lesson by {Color:31}Yukimura{Color:33} and {Poke}{C1}!{End}
    {Unk2 P:26}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Especially when they're pretty... Don't you think, {Poke}{C1}?{End}
    {Unk2 P:27}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}No, indeed! It is those won with honor which lead the world to truth. {End}
    {Unk2 P:28}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}...What matters is the strength that you carry in your heart!{End}
    {Unk2 P:29}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}They are the world to me! I will give all I have to protect them!{End}
    {Unk2 P:30}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Hey, hey, you're right! That one over there is really quite handsome, isn't he... {End}
    {Unk2 P:31}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}{Poke}{C1} and {Color:31}Ranmaru{Color:33} are at your service!{End}
    {Unk2 P:32}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}On this field of battle!{End}
    {Unk2 P:33}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Let our Warrior spirit pave the way to a glorious victory!{End}
    {Unk2 P:34}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Come on, {Poke}{C1}! Let's do this in style!{End}
    {Unk2 P:35}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}In due course, all will become clear.{End}
    {Unk2 P:36}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Never mind who might try and stand in our way.{End}
    {Unk2 P:37}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Let's crush 'em into crumbs!{End}
    {Unk2 P:100}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}We better give it everything, {Poke}{C1}!{End}
    {Unk2 P:101}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}That's a Warrior's greatest joy right there! Right, {Poke}{C1}―let us go and fight!{End}
    {Unk2 P:102}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}...Do that, and we're bound to win! Aren't we, {Poke}{C1}?!{End}
    {Unk2 P:103}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}When you and I are together, the enemy will be helpless!{End}
    {Unk2 P:104}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}No matter the situation I'm in, I always feel unbeatable!{End}
    {Unk2 P:105}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I'm so glad I have you by my side!{End}
    {Unk2 P:106}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I can't get enough of the thrill of battle!{End}
    {Unk2 P:107}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}That means I've got to make each and every battle count!{End}
    {Unk2 P:108}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}There never has been anything which beats the power of sheer strategy...and there never will be!{End}
    {Unk2 P:109}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Strategy is also vital in bringing about success...{End}
    {Unk2 P:110}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}With both wisdom and strategy on our side, we have nothing left to fear!{End}
    {Unk2 P:111}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}B-But I feel a bit b-braver when there are P-Pokémon around...{End}
    {Unk2 P:112}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I for one am looking forward to a nice hot cup of tea when it's all over...{End}
    {Unk2 P:113}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You can rely on me too, you know, {Poke}{C1}!{End}
    {Unk2 P:114}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I must give my all too, or it would not be fair!{End}
    {Unk2 P:116}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Let's get in, blow 'em away, then head on home!{End}
    {Unk2 P:117}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Let's knock them all into the ground, {Poke}{C1}!{End}
    {Unk2 P:118}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But sometimes I can't help but think it might be nicer to read poetry together...or have a cup of tea...{End}
    {Unk2 P:119}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Let's win this battle and get down to what really matters―trading!{End}
    {Unk2 P:121}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}So you'll do your best for me, won't you, {Poke}{C1}!{End}
    {Unk2 P:122}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}That goes for you too, {Poke}{C1}. No mistakes now!{End}
    {Unk2 P:123}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}{Poke}{C1}, let us fulfill our duty as ninjas...{End}
    {Unk2 P:124}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But it's quite hard to act shadowlike on the battlefield, isn't it...{End}
    {Unk2 P:125}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Witness the power that comes when Pokémon and ninja unite!{End}
    {Unk2 P:126}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But it's when we're in battle together that I feel like we're the closest!{End}
    {Unk2 P:128}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I want you to show me just how much grit you've got, {Poke}{C1}!{End}
    {Unk2 P:129}{C1}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Who would have thought that just being around them could be so much fun?! {End}
    {C1}{End}
