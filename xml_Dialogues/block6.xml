  <Text ID="13">{C1}{Char:1002}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Here you can spend {Color:32}gold{Color:33} to upgrade the locations in your kingdom.

  <Text ID="14">{C1}{Char:1002}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}By the way, I recommend that you invest your {Color:32}gold{Color:33} very {Color:32}wisely{Color:33}. Make smart choices, and you'll see the rewards! Now then, please choose the location you wish to invest in.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="21">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well hello there! What'll it be today?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="22">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Welcome! How are you feeling today?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="23">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}A very good day to you. I hope you've been keeping well?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="24">{C1}{Char:1015}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Welcome, and thank you for coming! Shall I tell you a little about combining {Color:32}items{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="25">{C1}{Char:1015}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}At the Blacksmith, you can combine two or more {Color:32}items{Color:33} to make another {Color:32}item{Color:33} that you can equip! If you come across any {Color:32}items{Color:33}, especially {Color:32}elements{Color:33}, be sure to bring them here!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="26">{C1}{Char:1015}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I should let you know, making rare {Color:32}items{Color:33} requires many {Color:32}items{Color:33} to be combined together. Some rare {Color:32}items{Color:33} can only be made by combining other rare {Color:32}items{Color:33}! I wish you luck in your search!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="27">{C1}{Char:1015}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I have a feeling I'm going to be meeting a lot of interesting people from now on. I can't wait. Life is so much easier when you're dealing with customers who are so {Color:32}charismatic{Color:33}... Now then, please choose which {Color:32}item{Color:33} you'd like to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="28">{C1}{Char:1015}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now then, please choose which {Color:32}item{Color:33} you'd like to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="29">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hey there, good to see you! Want me to tell you how to combine {Color:32}items{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2a">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well, here at the Blacksmith, you can combine two or more {Color:32}items{Color:33} to make another {Color:32}item{Color:33} that you can equip! So if you find any {Color:32}items{Color:33} anywhere, especially {Color:32}elements{Color:33}, make sure you bring them along, all right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2b">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh yeah! I have to tell you about making rare {Color:32}items{Color:33}! For them, you need to combine lots of different {Color:32}items{Color:33}. Making some of these rare {Color:32}items{Color:33} even involves combining other rare {Color:32}items{Color:33}! Good luck with all your item searching!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2c">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The good bit about being an artisan is that I can choose who I work for. There really ain't nothing better than customers who are {Color:32}charismatic{Color:33}. All right, go ahead and choose which {Color:32}item{Color:33} you want to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2d">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}All right, go ahead and choose which {Color:32}item{Color:33} you want to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2e">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}A good day to you, and a thousand welcomes to this humble Alchemist's place of business! Would you care to hear a little about how to combine your {Color:32}items{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2f">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Very well! Here, you may combine two or more {Color:32}items{Color:33} to create another, completely new {Color:32}item{Color:33} that can be used! Should you find any {Color:32}items{Color:33} on your travels, particularly {Color:32}elements{Color:33}, I would strongly advise you to bring them here!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="30">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The rarer the {Color:32}item{Color:33} that is being made, the rarer the {Color:32}items{Color:33} that are required to make it! Indeed, some of the {Color:32}items{Color:33} that you will be combining are rather rare in themselves. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you luck in your search for {Color:32}items{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="31">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I should imagine that I shall be meeting all sorts of people here. How exciting! I do hope some of them will be a little {Color:32}charismatic{Color:33}... Now then, please choose which {Color:32}item{Color:33} you would like to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="32">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now then, please go ahead and choose an {Color:32}item{Color:33} to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="33">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hello there, and many thanks for coming! Now then, would you like to hear a few wise words about combining your {Color:32}items{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="34">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Here, you can combine two or more {Color:32}items{Color:33} to make another {Color:32}item{Color:33} that you can then make use of. Be sure to bring me any {Color:32}items{Color:33} you find on your adventures, especially {Color:32}elements{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="35">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}One more thing: The rarer the {Color:32}item{Color:33} you want to make, the rarer the {Color:32}items{Color:33} you'll need to make it! In fact, some of the {Color:32}items{Color:33} you'll be combining are pretty rare themselves. All the best with your item hunting, friend!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="36">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I imagine I'll be getting all sorts of customers in here! Pretty exciting for an old man like me. I just hope some of them are somewhat {Color:32}charismatic{Color:33}... All right, please choose which {Color:32}item{Color:33} you'd like to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="37">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}All right, please choose which {Color:32}item{Color:33} you'd like to make!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="38">{C1}{Char:1015}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What would you like to make?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="39">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}So, what'll it be?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3a">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Have you perhaps decided on an item to make?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3b">{C1}{Char:1012}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What'll it be, friend?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3c">
    {C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}|02,64,64{C1}...
    {C1}Are you sure this is what you want to make?{End}
  </Text>
  <Text ID="3d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}By a great stroke of fortune, the item |02,64,64{C1} has been created!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The item |02,64,64{C1} has been created.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The combination ended in failure. The item |02,64,64{C1} could not be created. Instead, you ended up with a pile of {Color:32}junk{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="40">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Are you sure you want to stop combining items?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="41">{C1}{Char:1015}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Thank you very much! Come again soon!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="42">{C1}{Char:1014}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Thanks a lot! See you again!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="43">{C1}{Char:1013}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Most sincere thanks to you, dear customer. I hope to see you again soon.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Excuse me... Would you mind accompanying me on a short walk?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="46">{C1}{Char:1010}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}You there! Yes, you! Tell me, do you feel a curious power in these parts too?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="47">{C1}{Char:1011}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hey, tell me―do you feel some strange power around here?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="48">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}How do you do? It would appear that the majestic power of the woods has drawn you here. Shall I tell you a little about this place?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="49">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This is a place in which you can improve your stats: {Color:32}Power{Color:33}, {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33}, and {Color:32}Charisma{Color:33}. I suppose I should also tell you that those endowed with great {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33} are better at finding spots such as this one, where the forest's power is strong.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4a">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}You do know about your stats, don't you? The higher your {Color:32}Power{Color:33}, the more damage your partner Pokémon does when it attacks; the higher your {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33}, the less damage it receives when it is attacked; and the higher your {Color:32}Charisma{Color:33}, the easier it is for your Pokémon to hit enemies and dodge enemy attacks. Improving your stats also makes some locations more effective.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4b">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}One more thing: your {Color:32}Capacity{Color:33} dictates the number of Pokémon with which you can link. Exceed this number, and you shall have to say goodbye to one of your beloved Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4c">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now, since you've come all this way, would you mind accompanying me on a short walk?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4d">{C1}{Char:1010}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Aha! Been drawn here by the mysterious power, have you? Just as I thought... Now, I suppose I should tell you a few things about this place, eh?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:1010}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well, this is a place in which you can improve your stats: {Color:32}Power{Color:33}, {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33}, and {Color:32}Charisma{Color:33}. People like me who have a lot of {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33} are better at finding spots like this, by the way.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:1010}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now, you know what these stats mean, don't you? The higher your {Color:32}Power{Color:33}, the more damage you do when you attack; the higher your {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33}, the less damage you receive when you are attacked; and the higher your {Color:32}Charisma{Color:33}, the easier it is to hit enemies with your attacks and dodge enemy attacks. Better stats mean you'll get more out of some locations, too.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:1010}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh, and one more thing: your {Color:32}Capacity{Color:33} indicates the number of Pokémon with which you can link. You can't go over this number, so if you're full up, you'll have to let one of them go...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:1010}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Right, let's go see if we can feel some of that mysterious power, shall we?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="52">{C1}{Char:1011}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hm? Ah, you've been drawn here by the mysterious power, right? I guess I should tell you a bit about this place, then?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:1011}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This is a place where your stats can be improved: {Color:32}Power{Color:33}, {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33}, and {Color:32}Charisma{Color:33}.

Some locations are more effective when you've got better stats, too.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:1011}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Also, your {Color:32}Capacity{Color:33} refers to the number of Pokémon you can be linked with. Go over this number, and you'll have to part with one of them.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="56">{C1}{Char:1011}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Right, shall we go and feel some of that curious power, then?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="57">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}{Color:32}Power{Color:33}, {Color:32}Wisdom{Color:33}, and {Color:32}Charisma{Color:33} have all increased by {Turns}{C1} points.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:1009}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Incidentally, this forest is home to a most peculiar tree. It is said that resting under it will give your stats a further boost. Would you care to give it a try?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="59">{C1}{Char:1010}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh! Want to improve your stats some more, do you? Well, all right. Try popping over there. If you're lucky, your stats should get another boost. I have heard that stats sometimes get sapped as well, though...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:1011}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Actually, there's a place near here that can improve your stats even more. It doesn't work every time, but why don't you give it a go?{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hello there and welcome! Be sure to try one of my homemade {Color:32}ponigiri{Color:33}, won't you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="75">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh, it's your first time? I'll tell you a bit about what we do here, then, yeah?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This is a place where you can train with your Pokémon to increase their {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Huh? What's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}? Well, it's like a measure of a Pokémon's enthusiasm―something like that. The higher a Pokémon's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}, the stronger they are in battle!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Problem is, though, {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} levels change every three months or so, depending on the Pokémon. It's pretty tough to have all your Pokémon in peak form at the same time!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}So, if you got an important battle coming up, be sure to come here and do some training first, all right? Now then, how 'bout I give your Pokémon a little workout?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now then, how 'bout I give your Pokémon a little workout?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}First time, is it? Shall I tell you about what we do here, then?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7c">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This is a place where you can train your Pokémon in order to increase their {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7d">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}{Color:32}Energy{Color:33} is a measure of a Pokémon's enthusiasm. The higher it is, the stronger they are in battle.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7e">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Every Pokémon's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} level is different, and it changes every three months or so. That's why it's so difficult to have all your Pokémon in top condition at the same time.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7f">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}If you have an important battle coming up, be sure to bring your Pokémon here for some training beforehand. Now then, let us begin.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="80">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Understood. Let us begin the training session.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="81">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Welcome to the Dragon Chamber! I can see that this is your first time here. Would you care for a brief explanation of the services we offer?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="82">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This is a place where you undergo training with your Pokémon in order to increase their {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}. {End}</Text>
  <Text ID="83">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}{Color:32}Energy{Color:33} is rather like enthusiasm, I suppose you could say, and the higher a Pokémon's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}, the stronger it is in battle.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="84">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Every Pokémon's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} level is different and will change every three months or so. Having all your Pokémon in top condition at the same time is therefore rather challenging.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="85">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Should you have an important battle coming up, I recommend that you pay me a visit! Now then, let's proceed to the training ground!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="86">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Very well, let's proceed to the training ground!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="87">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well, hello there! I've not seen you around here before. Would you like to hear a little about the services we offer here at the {Color:32}Ponigiri Shop{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="88">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The {Color:32}Ponigiri Shop{Color:33} is a place where you can buy {Color:32}ponigiri{Color:33} to feed to your Pokémon to restore their {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}! {End}</Text>
  <Text ID="89">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hmm? What exactly is this {Color:32}Energy{Color:33}, you ask? Well, it's kind of a measure of your Pokémon's enthusiasm, I suppose. The higher it is, the more powerful they are!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Now, every Pokémon has a different {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} level. What's more, their {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} levels change every three months or so. In other words, it's very hard to have all your Pokémon in top condition at the same time!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}That's why you should be sure to drop by for some {Color:32}ponigiri{Color:33} if you've got a big battle coming up. In fact, how about I serve one up right now?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Really? All right then. Time to chow down on some tasty {Color:32}ponigiri{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The Pokémon's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} has reached its maximum level.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The Warrior's health decreased by {Color:32}3{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}{Color:32}Energy{Color:33} level increased significantly.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="90">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}{Color:32}Energy{Color:33} level increased.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="91">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}{Color:32}Energy{Color:33} level increased.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="92">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}So, what'll it be?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="93">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Those are some mighty impressive moves! Say, how about we try a special training battle next? Win it, and your Pokémon's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} will go sky high for a little while! Lose, and they might feel a little down in the dumps, mind you...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="94">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Impressive. Are you interested in some additional training? If successful, it should ensure that your Pokémon remains energetic for the foreseeable future. Failure may have some unwanted side effects, however...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="95">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Nice work! You really do appear to know what you're doing. In fact, perhaps you would like to try your hand at some top-level training? If it's a success, your Pokémon will stay in top condition for a considerable while. I must warn you, however, that they might start feeling rather glum if the training fails...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="96">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well, well, it seems like someone has a healthy appetite! I suppose I'd better give you a second helping! This will put an extra spring in your Pokémon's step―but be careful not to overindulge!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="97">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}All right! Let's do this!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="98">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Good. Let us begin.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="99">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Excellent! Please, follow me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9a">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Alrighty then, get 'em while they're fresh!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}A special training battle has been held.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}A special training session was held.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}A top-level training session was held.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The Pokémon received a second helping.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9f">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}You sure? Seems a bit of a shame...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a0">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh. And I had such high hopes for you...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a1">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Very well. But do be sure to come and give it a try sometime!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a2">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Are you sure? You're not just being polite, are you?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a3">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The training battle was a success. The Pokémon's mood has improved even further.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a4">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The special training was a success. The Pokémon's mood has improved even further.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="a8">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Hmm... Impressive.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a9">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Your top-level training was a great success! Congratulations!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="aa">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Enjoyed that, did you? I'm glad to hear it!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ab">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The training bout was lost. The Pokémon's mood has deteriorated.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ac">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The special training did not go well. The Pokémon's mood has deteriorated.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ad">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The top-level training was a failure. The Pokémon's mood has deteriorated.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="af">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What's that? You've had enough?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b0">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I think some more training is in order for you.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b1">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Don't worry―I'm sure your next training session will be a success...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b2">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh dear... It looks like someone's eaten too much!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b3">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Nothing happened.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b4">{C1}{Char:1017}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Come on―give it a bit more!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b5">{C1}{Char:1018}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}You need to show more motivation.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b6">{C1}{Char:1019}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I do think you could try a little harder...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b7">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh no! I forgot the key ingredient. I'm so sorry...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b8">{C1}{Char:1016}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Ponigiri will increase a Pokémon's {Color:32}Energy{Color:33} a little!{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="c3">{C1}{Char:1005}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This location here is a place where you can dig for {Color:32}gold{Color:33}! Be sure to dig {Color:32}powerfully{Color:33} to unearth as much as you can!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c4">{C1}{Char:1005}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What can be done with {Color:32}gold{Color:33}, you ask? Well, you can exchange it for goods at the {Color:32}Shop{Color:33}, for a start.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c5">{C1}{Char:1005}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh! And should you want to upgrade any locations within the kingdoms you control, you'll need to invest some {Color:32}gold{Color:33} at the {Color:32}Bank{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
