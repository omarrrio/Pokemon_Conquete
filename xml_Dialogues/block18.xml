  <Text ID="0">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I've never cared about other kingdoms.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}That's what I've always said, anyway...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}But I can't let them get away with just trampling all over Ransei!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}If they insist on collecting kingdoms, then I shall collect Warriors!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}With more allies on my side, they wouldn't dare attack us!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Heh. I'll show them what it really means to defend a kingdom.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Forty Warriors... Not bad.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}That should keep them quiet.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9">{C1}{Char:0012}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A fine performance.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a">{C1}{Char:0010}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Impressive, {Color:31}Ujiyasu{Color:33}! Looks like you haven't gone soft after all.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Did you come here just to say that?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c">{C1}{Char:0014}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}If you've got that much time on your hands, why don't you join my army?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Thus Ujiyasu assembled a great number of allies.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And also managed to reaffirm his old friendship with Shingen and Kenshin.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A friendship that lasted their entire lives.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="10">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="11">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Times were changing...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="12">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Central Ransei was entering a period more opulent than any it had seen before.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="13">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The beauty of its female Warlords had become famous...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="14">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And there was a growing clamor to find out who was the fairest of them all...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="15">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Well, well. This is interesting.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="16">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}A contest to see who will become Queen of Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="17">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Is there really anyone more suitable than me?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="18">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Just watch...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="19">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I will show everyone how...dangerous this beauty can be.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1a">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1b">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Hehe...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1c">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}That was an enjoyable diversion.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1d">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}All those poor souls, looking lost on the battlefield...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1e">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Hehe... How adorable.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Nō won the contest of the female Warlords.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="20">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Both her beauty and her ferocity in {Color:34}battle{Color:33} would be spoken of for years to come.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="21">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="22">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}People with the ability to communicate with Pokémon were referred to using the title of Warrior.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="23">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Among these Warriors were a group, mainly hailing from the kingdoms of {Color:32}Viperia{Color:33} and {Color:32}Yaksha{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="24">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}for whom the protection of their lords was the only goal. These loyal Warriors were known as ninjas.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="25">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Three such ninjas, {Color:31}Kotarō{Color:33}, {Color:30}Hanzō{Color:33}, and {Color:30}Kunoichi{Color:33}, were always bickering about their role in society...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="26">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And today was no exception...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="27">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Pathetic. So much talk and so little knowledge...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="28">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Oh, not again!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="29">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}You can't keep arguing like this all the time!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2a">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Now, just give me a minute...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2b">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Excitable as ever...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2c">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}All right, I'm back!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2d">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Now, I've borrowed some nearby castles so we can settle this once and for all.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2e">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}So less arguing and more battling. All right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2f">{C1}{Char:0023}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Are we really going to do this?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="30">{C1}{Char:0022}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="31">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Ha... This will be enjoyable.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="32">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}All right? Now only use your Poison-type, Ghost-type, and Dark-type Pokémon, just like a ninja should!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="33">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And... We need one more type, so...Dragon will do just fine!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="34">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I'll be taking part too, of course!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="35">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}You believe you have a chance against me? Ha.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="36">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Very well. I shall humor you.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="37">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="38">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Ha. Your actions cannot live up to your words...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="39">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}But that was enjoyable, I must admit. Perhaps I shall toy with you again sometime.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3a">{C1}{Char:0016}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Farewell...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3b">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Huh?! Oh! He's gone...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3c">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}When will that naughty boy ever learn?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3d">{C1}{Char:0009}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so the ninja conflict drew to a close.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Kotarō was the victor...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="40">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And an increasing number of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}'s {Color:34}Warlords{Color:33} began to compete for his services...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="41">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="42">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}After {Name}{C1} had united Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="43">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And returned all its castles to their original owners...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="44">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The following exchange took place in the kingdom of {Color:31}Valora{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I should imagine that the world will now know peace once more.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="46">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Just as I have wished for, all my long life...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="47">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I have been blessed with such wonderful allies. There is nothing left for me to desire.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="48">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Respectfully, Lord {Color:31}Ieyasu{Color:33}, I must disagree.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="49">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}There is much we have yet to accomplish.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4a">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Oh...? To what are you referring?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4b">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Pokémon, my lord.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4c">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Partnering with Pokémon is what a Warrior lives for.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4d">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}We should not forget that we Warriors are privileged to be able to communicate with Pokémon in the way that we do.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}...Hm. You are correct, {Color:31}Tadakatsu{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Very well. We shall seek to increase our Pokémon partners.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}One hundred would appear to be a reasonable number to aim for.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="52">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Oh ho... It would appear our forces now contain one hundred Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="54">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A wonderful achievement, Lord {Color:31}Ieyasu{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I always knew you'd do it, Lord {Color:31}Ieyasu{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="56">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}It is all thanks to your hard work.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="57">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Please, allow me to express my gratitude once more.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I truly have been blessed with the most wonderful allies.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="59">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Ieyasu gathered together a large number of {Color:34}Pokémon{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}earning the respect and admiration of several {Color:34}Warriors{Color:33} in the process.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5b">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Once upon a time, at a gathering of Ransei's Warlords, a decision was reached:{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}a test was to be carried out to determine the strength of each kingdom's junior Warriors.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A Warrior would be selected from each kingdom, assigned a castle at random, and asked to demonstrate their skills on the battlefield.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5f">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Warlords themselves were not allowed to offer any help...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="60">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}All right, I have decided.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="61">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}The Warrior that shall represent our kingdom is...{Wait:30}20 {Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="62">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Eh? Me?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="63">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Yeah, of course!{Wait:30}20 There's no one out there that's a match for you!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="64">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Oh, my lord...{Wait:30}20 Can't you just let me sleep?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="65">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}I really can't be bothered with this, {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}. Let's get it over with as soon as possible...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="66">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Watch your mouth in front of Lord {Color:31}Hideyoshi{Color:33}, {Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="67">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Hehe. Didn't you hear him, {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="68">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}I'm the Warlord of this kingdom now.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="69">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}He should be the one who watches his mouth in front of me!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6a">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6b">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}That's the spirit, {Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}! Now, don't let me down, all right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6c">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6d">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Yee-hah! You did it! Great work, {Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6e">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}It was nothing. That's just the way I―(cough) (cough cough cough)...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6f">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}Wh-What's the matter, {Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}?! Surely you haven't caught a cold?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="70">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}No, it's nothing. Just something in my throat.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="71">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="72">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Don't make that face, {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}. You should be happy for me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="73">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}...I was born with this face.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}You're not wrong! And your kids will probably look like that as well, {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="75">{C1}{Char:0003}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}{Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}! Don't be so cruel! Haha!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so, Hanbei won the contest between the junior Warriors...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And returned to his kingdom where he could spend his days sleeping.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Who knows when he will decide to show the world what he is really capable of...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}After {Name}{C1} had successfully united Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Color:31}Hideyoshi{Color:33}, the Warlord of {Color:31}Ignis{Color:33}, suddenly decided to leave his kingdom...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Leaving {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33} and {Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33} in charge of gathering Pokémon...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7d">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}To be honest, being a Warlord is just a pain. Why don't you do it, {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7e">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}In fact, I'm older than you, so it's my decision! From now on, you're the Warlord around here!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7f">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Are you sure about this, {Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="80">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Hm? Yeah, of course. It's all yours, {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="81">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}So, what are your orders, Lord {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="82">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Simply to work hard until we achieve our objective.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="83">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}If we can collect one hundred Pokémon, Lord {Color:31}Hideyoshi{Color:33} will be pleased.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="84">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Oh! Aiming a little high, aren't we?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="85">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}All right, let's do this!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="86">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="87">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Three cheers for Lord {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="88">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}You did it, my lord.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="89">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}Looks like we work well together, eh? Two geniuses are pretty tough to stop.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Color:31}Hanbei{Color:33}... Why did you let me be Warlord...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Hey, now... I don't want to talk about that.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I just wanted to see what you were really capable of, Lord {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8d">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}I wanted to see you...{Wait:30}20smile!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8e">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}...You know that's not my thing.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8f">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}What? Come on, man! There are times when it's all right to smile, you know! Times like this!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="90">{C1}{Char:0019}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I wouldn't know.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="91">{C1}{Char:0018}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}You're just way too uptight, Lord {Color:31}Kanbei{Color:33}. But I guess you're not going to change. Okay, what's our next mission...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="92">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Kanbei successfully gathered one hundred {Color:34}Pokémon{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="93">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And that was only the first of the many things he achieved alongside Hanbei in the name of Lord Hideyoshi.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="94">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="95">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Once upon a time, at a gathering of Ransei's Warlords, a decision was reached:{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="96">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}a test was to be carried out to determine the strength of each kingdom's junior Warriors.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="97">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A Warrior would be selected from each kingdom, assigned a castle at random, and asked to demonstrate their skills on the battlefield.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="98">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Warlords themselves were not allowed to offer any help...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="99">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You will not actually be doing battle for the castles. It is merely a kind of game...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9a">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}But this does not mean that defeat will be tolerated!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9b">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You understand, don't you, {Color:31}Muneshige{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9c">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Perfectly. I knew that you would feel this way.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9d">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}So, the first person to unite Ransei is the winner...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9e">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}This might be just a game, but...it sounds like I'm going to achieve your ambition before you do, {Color:31}Ginchiyo{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9f">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a0">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a1">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Well, well. I did not expect such success, I must say.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a2">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Indeed. I think being Warlord rather suits me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a3">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}Such insolence! I am the only Warlord around here!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a4">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}You may be a Warlord here in Ransei.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a5">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}But I don't think the rest of the world cares about the squabbles that happen here.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a6">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Do you, {Color:31}Ginchiyo{Color:33}?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a7">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}The...world?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a8">{C1}{Char:0005}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:33}I will not be taken in by such ridiculous talk!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a9">{C1}{Char:0020}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Hehe...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="aa">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so, Muneshige won the contest between the junior Warriors...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ab">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}and promptly disappeared.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ac">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Who knows whether he will ever return to Ginchiyo's side...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ad">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ae">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Once upon a time, at a gathering of Ransei's Warlords, a decision was reached:{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="af">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}a test was to be carried out to determine the strength of each kingdom's junior Warriors.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b0">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A Warrior would be selected from each kingdom, assigned a castle at random, and asked to demonstrate their skills on the battlefield.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b1">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Warlords themselves were not allowed to offer any help...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b2">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}So...{Wait:30}20 You want me to become a Warlord and help you unite all of Ransei, Father?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b3">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}No. I am not permitted to assist you in any way.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b4">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}This is a test for junior Warriors, not for Warlords.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b5">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}If I were to involve myself...it would be akin to a parent fighting their children's battles.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b6">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Oh...{Wait:30}20 So I would have to do battle without you, Father...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b7">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Yes. I know you don't want to leave my side. Without me, you―{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b8">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}I'll do it! I've always wanted to visit other kingdoms!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b9">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}With you telling me never to leave the castle, I hardly ever get the chance to travel...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="ba">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}But this contest will let me travel as much as I want!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bb">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Hmm...{Wait:30}20 I'm not sure this is such a good idea...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bc">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bd">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}I did it! I'm number one!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="be">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Indeed. You did very well.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="bf">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Father!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c0">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}I always knew that you were a child who could achieve anything you put your mind to.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c1">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}However...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c2">{C1}{Char:0007}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}I do wish you could show a little more humility and grace, as befits a lady...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c3">{C1}{Char:0021}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}What?! You're telling me off now, of all times?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c4">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so Gracia won the contest between the junior Warriors.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c5">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The new friends and fond memories she made would stay with her for life...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c6">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Though she would never be as humble or as ladylike as her father would wish.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c7">{C1}{Char:0022}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
