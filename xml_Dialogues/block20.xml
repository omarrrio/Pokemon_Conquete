  <Text ID="1">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Well...okay. I guess there'll be lots of guys taking part in this contest too, right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Yes, indeed. It would appear that many male Warriors of great renown are participat―{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Oh, great! In that case...I'm definitely doing it!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Oh...{Wait:30}20 Is it all over?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6">{C1}{Char:0015}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}What's the matter? You don't appear to be enjoying your victory.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}It's just...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}There are probably loads of wonderful men in Ransei that I haven't met yet...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I know! I'll go on a journey!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="a">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}That way I'm sure to meet my soul mate!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="b">{C1}{Char:0029}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Oh, I can't wait!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Thus, Okuni won the contest between the junior Warriors...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And decided to embark on a journey all around the region of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Indeed, her current whereabouts are a mystery to all.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="10">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Times were changing...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="11">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Central Ransei was entering a period more opulent than any it had seen before.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="12">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The beauty of its female Warlords had become famous...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="13">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And there was a growing clamor to find out who was the fairest of them all...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="14">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Why me...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="15">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}I am a man... But no one will listen!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="16">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}Is anyone going to notice...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="17">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}But I don't want to ruin the contest. Everyone in Ransei is so excited, after all...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="18">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}If only Lord {Color:31}Nobunaga{Color:33} were here...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="19">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}But he has gone away, entrusting me with the castle.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1a">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Well, there is only one thing for it!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1b">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I must battle as if my very life depended on it!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1c">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1d">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}I won, but...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1e">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Now it's going to be even harder for me to tell the world that I'm a man...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="1f">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:32}Does that really matter, though...?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="20">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}It does not.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="21">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}Lord {Color:31}Nobunaga{Color:33}...!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="22">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}You have done well.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="23">{C1}{Char:0001}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}{Color:31}Nobunaga{Color:33} is here to praise you for your efforts.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="24">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Oh...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="25">{C1}{Char:0030}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Nothing could make me happier than hearing those words, my lord!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="26">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so, Ranmaru won the contest of the female Warlords.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="27">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}He returned Nobunaga's castle to him and continues to serve him to this day.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="29">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Once upon a time, at a gathering of Ransei's Warlords, a decision was reached:{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}a test was to be carried out to determine the strength of each kingdom's junior Warriors.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A Warrior would be selected from each kingdom, assigned a castle at random, and asked to demonstrate their skills on the battlefield.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The Warlords themselves were not allowed to offer any help...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2d">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}The decision to hold this contest is music to my ears.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2e">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}After all, my army contains one of the greatest Warriors in all of Ransei.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2f">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I have very high hopes for you, {Color:31}Tadakatsu{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="30">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Naturally.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="31">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}I shall show the world how a true Warrior does battle, my lord.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="32">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Victory will surely follow.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="33">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="34">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Excellent work, {Color:31}Tadakatsu{Color:33}! That was some truly wonderful battling.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="35">{C1}{Char:0017}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Being able to work alongside a talented Warrior such as yourself is a great honor for me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="36">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Thank you, my lord. You are most kind.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="37">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Yet all I did was focus on the battle in front of me. It is all a Warrior can ever do.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="38">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}Father, that was wonderful! I shall take inspiration from your performance!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="39">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Thus Tadakatsu won the contest between the junior Warriors,{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}and became known as the greatest {Color:34}Warrior{Color:33} in all of {Color:34}Ransei{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Despite this, he remained loyal to Ieyasu for the rest of his days.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3c">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Times were changing...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="40">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And there was a growing clamor to find out who was the fairest of them all...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="41">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}So many female Warlords... Seven in total―what a curious twist of fate...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="42">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}But I am {Color:31}Ina{Color:33}. My father, {Color:31}Tadakatsu{Color:33}, is the greatest Warrior in the Ransei region.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="43">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Anything but victory is unacceptable!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="44">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}It's...finally over...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="46">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:31}I have shown the world what it means to be a Warrior!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="47">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Fine work, {Color:31}Ina{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="48">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:34}Father! You were watching?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="49">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}What did you think? Am I worthy of you yet?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4a">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}You won the contest. That means you have talent.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4b">{C1}{Char:0031}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}But you mustn't forget. Talent alone is not enough.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4c">{C1}{Char:0032}{NameColor:31}{CharImage:30}Yes, Father!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4d">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And so, Ina won the contest of the female Warlords.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}She impressed all observers with her devotion to duty and her dedication to the way of the {Color:34}Warrior{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="4f">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="50">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}After {Name}{C1} had successfully united Ransei...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="51">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{Color:30}Kotarō{Color:33}, Warlord of {Color:30}Yaksha{Color:33}, disappeared, along with his followers.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="52">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Just as rumors concerning the missing Warlord were spreading...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="53">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}The kingdom of {Color:30}Yaksha{Color:33} received a visit...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="54">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}...I see. That's bad news.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="55">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}A kingdom without a Warlord... That just doesn't work.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="56">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}You need to find a replacement, fast.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="57">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Huh? Me?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="58">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}No way, I'm just a drifter.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="59">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I just wander from kingdom to kingdom, following my nose. That's the life for me.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5a">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Having said that, though, these people are in a jam.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5b">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I guess I could take over, just until they find a permanent replacement.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5c">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And I think the first thing I'll do as Warlord is start gathering some Pokémon.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5d">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}This place needs a bit of extra life. I think a hundred Pokémon or so should do the trick.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5e">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="5f">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}A hundred Pokémon already?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="60">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Well, that should be enough to keep this place going.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="61">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I'm a drifter, see. I don't like to be tied down. Not to people, and not to kingdoms.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="62">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}It's not easy sometimes, but it's the only life I know.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="63">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Looks like the people here don't need me anymore.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="64">{C1}{Char:0033}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Time for me to hit the road!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="65">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Thus, as soon as Keiji had gathered one hundred {Color:34}Pokémon{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="66">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}he set off on his travels once more.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="67">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="68">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Some trivial matter had caused {Color:31}Mitsunari{Color:33}, {Color:30}Kiyomasa{Color:33}, and {Color:30}Masanori{Color:33} to argue.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="69">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Unable to resolve their differences, the three went their separate ways, each to a different kingdom.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6a">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}That was not to be the last they would see of each other, however...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6b">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}No sooner do I become Warlord of {Color:31}Ignis{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6c">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Than I hear word that those two are now Warlords of {Color:30}Fontaine{Color:33} and {Color:30}Greenleaf{Color:33}...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6d">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But they are no match for me!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6e">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I'll show them who's boss!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="6f">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="70">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Now do you get it? You two just aren't a match for me!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="71">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Argh! Your head is far too big for your own good...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="72">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}...And yours aren't big enough. But I suppose you could be of some help to me nonetheless.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="73">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}Maybe serving under me would help those impoverished brains of yours to grow a little bit.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="74">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Hmph. He's insufferable.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="75">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Look, if you want our help, just ask us.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="76">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}I want no such th―!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="77">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Oh, so that's what you mean! For someone who's so clever, you're pretty hard to understand...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="78">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}This is why I set out on my own in the first place!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="79">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Don't worry! Come on, come with us...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7a">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}We'll go to the beach and have some fun!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7b">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}After Mitsunari won the conflict, the three became friends once more...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7c">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Although it was just a matter of time before they would fall out again.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7d">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="7e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Some trivial matter had caused {Color:30}Mitsunari{Color:33}, {Color:31}Kiyomasa{Color:33}, and {Color:30}Masanori{Color:33} to argue.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="82">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And it seems those two have managed to become Warlords of {Color:30}Ignis{Color:33} and {Color:30}Fontaine{Color:33}.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="83">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}But I haven't forgotten what they did to me!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="84">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}And now's the time to make them pay!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="85">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="86">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}...I am exhausted.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="87">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And all for such a childish argument. I don't even remember what it was about.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="88">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And now, it has led to us staking our castles on the argument.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="89">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}All I did was cause a lot of trouble for the people of my kingdom...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8a">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:32}And now that it's over, I don't feel any better...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8b">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Eh? Why are you looking so sad all by yourself?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8c">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Hmph. I...I can't stand seeing you all alone like this.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8d">{C1}{Char:0035}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Y-You two?!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8e">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Come on, let's go to the seaside! You like the seaside, right?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="8f">{C1}{Char:0034}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}I don't see the attraction myself, but if that's what's been decided...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="90">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}After Kiyomasa won the conflict, the three became friends once more...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="91">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}Although it was just a matter of time before they would fall out again.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="96">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}So I somehow became Warlord of this {Color:31}Fontaine{Color:33} place...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="97">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:30}And it looks like those two are the Warlords of {Color:30}Ignis{Color:33} and {Color:30}Greenleaf{Color:33}!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="98">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I'll show those brainiacs who's boss!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="99">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:33}I'll show them I was right!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9a">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="9c">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:31}So I was right! I―{Wait:30}20 Uhh...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="9d">{C1}{Char:0036}{NameColor:30}{CharImage:34}Hmm?! Um... I've forgotten what we were arguing about!{End}</Text>
