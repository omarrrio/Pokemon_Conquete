  <Text ID="29">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Greetings! Welcome to my {Color:32}Power Plant{Color:33}! So... Do you need me to explain what this {Color:32}Power Plant{Color:33} does?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2a">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Very well! This place produces a strange energy, see―one that summons wild Pokémon to the area for a period of one month! You should use the Power Plant if you want to strengthen your {Color:32}link{Color:33} with your partner Pokémon or if you want to summon some shy Pokémon that are difficult to meet! Use it {Color:32}wisely{Color:33}, okay?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2b">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh, and one more thing, before I forget! After the Power Plant's been used, you can't use it again until it's been recharged! Okay? All right! Let's do this! Press that button!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2c">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well then! There's no need to be shy! Press that button!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2d">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Well, it looks like it's your first visit here. Would you like me to explain how this {Color:32}Windmill{Color:33} works?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2e">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This Windmill generates a mysterious allure that summons Pokémon to the area for a period of one month. You should use it when you want to strengthen your {Color:32}link{Color:33} with a partner Pokémon or when you want to meet an especially elusive Pokémon. They say the {Color:32}wisest{Color:33} Warriors in the land are those who know the power of the Windmill.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="2f">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Just remember that the Windmill needs to recharge for a while after it's been used, meaning it can't be used. Now, press that button to make the Pokémon come running!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="30">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}All right, press that button to make the Pokémon come running!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="31">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What's that you say? You've had enough? Well...all right! Come back again sometime.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="32">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Are you calling it a day? Very well. Do come back again, though!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="33">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Wait just a moment! See that other button over there? That'll generate even more power and summon even more Pokémon to the area! ...Although it doesn't always work... What do you say? Want to give it a go?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="34">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh! I nearly forgot. I've tried modifying the Windmill so that it generates more power and summons even more Pokémon to the area! It's still a work in progress, but do you fancy giving it a try?{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="35">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}This is a modification I made myself―you'd better brace yourself for massive crowds of Pokémon! Massive crowds, I'm telling you! All right! Press that button!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="36">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The button has been pressed...{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="37">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}I've spent ages making this modification... I can't wait to see it in action!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="38">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The power to attract Pokémon has increased.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="39">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}What?! You're looking this gift horse in the mouth?! Well, fine. Stick to the ordinary button if that's what you want.{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="3e">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The machine broke. No Pokémon have come to the area.{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="3f">{C1}{Char:1020}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}It... It broke?! This is all your fault! You must have pressed the button too hard!{End}</Text>
  <Text ID="40">{C1}{Char:1021}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}Oh no! It didn't work! Why does this keep happening to me...? My wife's going to be furious...{End}</Text>

  <Text ID="45">{C1}{Char:9999}{NameColor:33}{CharImage:30}The Pokémon that have appeared as a result of your entering the password will only be around for this month, so it is recommended that you save your game now. Once you save, you will not be able to use the password again.{End}</Text>
